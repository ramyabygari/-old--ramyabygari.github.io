# About Me

I am Ramya, working as a Data Scientist at [Razorpay][1] (unicorn startup in India).
I am also a research collaborator at [PathCheck][2] (checkout [covid-news.org][3]!),
an MIT Media lab Spin-Off and a research volunteer at University of Cambridge.
I  completed my Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science at the [National Institute Of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal][4], in 2020.

My main research interests  are machine learning and building scalable systems for ML (checkout my [github][5]).

I like gardening in my free time! A few roses below :)
