# About Me

I am pursuing a Master of Science degree in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, with a focus on Distributed Systems, Cloud Storage Systems. 

Outside of academia, my internship experience at Omnistrate. There, I engineered a dynamic horizontal autoscaling feature capable of adaptively managing CPU and memory allocation to optimize resource utilization and scalability in multi-tenant environments. This feature accommodated a diverse range of applications, from multiple writers to coupled/serverless architectures, and stateless/stateful apps. 

During my two-year tenure as a Software Engineer at Razorpay [1], I led an initiative that evolved a conventional batch processing system into a scalable stream processing ML system powered by Spark and Kafka. 
Furthermore, I built a pipeline to scale the transactions to be handled from 0.5 million to a million transactions per second, thereby significantly improving Razorpayâ€™s revenue.The result was not only enhanced success rates and user engagement but also a significant reduction in product gaps, underscoring my ability to address tangible real-world challenges in general-purpose computing and data processing. 


I like gardening in my free time! A few roses below :)
