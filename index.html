<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I am Ramya, pursuing my Master of Science degree in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (<a href="https://illinois.edu/">UIUC</a>). Prior to this, I worked as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://razorpay.com/">Razorpay</a>, a unicorn startup in India.</p>

<p>I am also a research volunteer at <a href="https://www.pathcheck.org/">PathCheck</a>, an MIT Media Lab spin-off, and a research collaborator at the University of Cambridge. My academic and professional journey has revolved around my fervent interest in designing and building robust distributed systems, versatile general-purpose computing solutions, and efficient storage systems.</p>

<p>I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.nitk.ac.in/">National Institute Of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal</a>, in 2020. My main research interests are in Distributed and Storage Systems, and you can explore my projects on my <a href="https://github.com/ramyabygari">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I am actively involved in personal projects, such as the ongoing "Distributed Serverless GNN Training Framework System," which leverages serverless computing for efficient Graph Neural Network (GNN) training. I have also made contributions to projects like "Exploiting Nil Externality in message queues" and "Syros - Read Optimized Consensus Protocol," demonstrating my dedication to pushing the boundaries of technological solutions within the dynamic realm of distributed systems.</p>

<p>My overarching career goal is to continue contributing my skills and passion to the design and development of cutting-edge distributed systems, versatile storage solutions, and high-performance general-purpose computing solutions, with a focus on solving challenging problems related to scalability, consensus, storage, memory, and fault tolerance. These areas closely align with my core interests and areas of expertise.</p>

<p>And in my free time, I enjoy gardening â€“ here are a few roses for you to see! ðŸŒ¹ðŸŒ¹ðŸŒ¹</p>
